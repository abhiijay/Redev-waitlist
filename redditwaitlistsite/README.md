## 🚀 Getting Started

3. **Test** the form functionality and responsive design
4. **Customize** colors, content, and styling as needed

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #FF4500;
    --secondary-color: #FF6B35;
    --background-dark: #0f0f23;
    --card-background: rgba(42, 42, 62, 0.5);
    --text-color: #ffffff;
}
```

### Adding Backend Integration
Replace the localStorage demo in `script.js` with your API calls:
```javascript
// Replace this section in script.js
fetch('/api/waitlist', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(waitlistEntry)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => showSuccess())
.catch(error => showError('Something went wrong. Please try again.'));
```

### Analytics Integration
Replace the console logging with your analytics service:
```javascript
// Replace trackEvent function in script.js
function trackEvent(eventName, properties = {}) {
    // Google Analytics
    gtag('event', eventName, properties);
    
    // Or Mixpanel
    mixpanel.track(eventName, properties);
}
```

## 📊 Form Data Storage

Currently, form submissions are stored in the browser's localStorage. In a production environment, you should:

1. **Set up a backend API** to handle form submissions
2. **Implement proper validation** on the server side
3. **Add email verification** for waitlist entries
4. **Set up a database** to store user data securely
5. **Add rate limiting** to prevent spam

- **Focus on Conversion**: Single purpose - collect leads
- **Dark Theme**: Reduces eye strain and looks professional
- **Clean Typography**: Clear hierarchy and readability
